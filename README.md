Fragranz
========

A reference app for TruckJS about perfumes and colognes.


To see this running, you'll need to first run a server instance in this directory. If you've got Python, you can just run this in your terminal/command prompt:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This is just a prototype. It's purpose is to show how to use Truck's models, views, routes, etc. to put an app together. Because this is not a real app, it has no data persistence or actual commercial transaction.
